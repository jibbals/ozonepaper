\section{Southern Ocean extrapolation}

\subsection{Outline}
  We use simulated tropospheric ozone columns from GEOS-Chem to extrapolate the ozonesonde-based estimates to the entire Southern Ocean region, defined here as 35$^{\circ}$ S-75$^{\circ}$ S to encompass our three measurement sites. 
  To do so, we multiply the monthly likelihoods of STTs (fraction of ozonesonde releases for which an STT event was detected, per month, \textit{f}) by the monthly mean fraction of the ozone column attributed to STT, \textit{I}) and by the monthly mean tropospheric ozone column over the Southern Ocean (from the GEOS-Chem multi-year mean, $\Omega_{SO_{O_3}}$), expressed simply as Flux$= \Omega_{SO_{O_3}} \times f \times I$.
  The monthly values of each term in this equation are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:SOExtrapolation} (upper panel).
  A more spatially resolved estimate could be determined by dividing the Southern Ocean region into longitudinal and latitudinal bins for calculating the average $\Omega_{SO_{O_3}}$ from GEOS-Chem, applying latitudinal gradients to $f$ and $I$ based on their values at the three sonde release sites, and adding longitudinal variability due to seasonal stratospheric wind jet streams \citep{Baray2012,Skerlak2015}, but this is beyond the scope of this work and in any case would not address the limitations of the estimate provided below.

  To give an idea of sensitivity to zonal definition, a change of the bounding latitudes by 5$^{\circ}$ in either direction at either end changes the average simulated tropospheric ozone by -7 to 9\%.
  It is worth noting that this extrapolation is very simplistic and is performed as a simple example of how the seasonal ozone STT calculations could be used.

\subsection{Results}
  
  Figure \ref{fig:SOExtrapolation} (lower panel) shows the resulting extrapolated monthly mean ozone flux from STT events over the Southern Ocean.
  Previous studies have found STT ozone fluxes in the SH extratropics are largest from autumn or winter to early spring \citep{Olsen2003, Liu2016}.
  At this time of year, we find the highest tropospheric $\Omega_{O3}$ but a relatively low STT flux due to reduced event frequency.
  Our results suggest instead that the ozone flux associated with STT events (at least those due to tropopause folds) is largest in austral summer (December-March), primarily due to an increased frequency of STT detections during these months.
  It is possible that our estimated event frequencies are too low in late winter-early spring as some legitimate STT events may have been excluded due to coincident smoke plumes.

  \end{figure}
  
  Summing the monthly estimated fluxes shown in Fig. \ref{fig:SOExtrapolation} over the year, we find from this estimate that STT events may be responsible for at least $3.1 \times10^{16}$~molecules cm$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ of the tropospheric ozone over the Southern Ocean, equivalent to 2.48~Tg yr$^{-1}$.
  %This is calculated using the surface area from GEOS-Chem over the Southern Ocean grid boxes along with the molecules cm$^{-2}$ per month calculations, along with ozone molar mass of 48~g mol$^{-1}$.
  Our estimate is smaller than expected from prior work that suggests global gross STT fluxes of 550~Tg yr$^{-1}$ \citep{Stevenson2006} and net downward STT fluxes of 75~Tg yr$^{-1}$ \citep{Sprenger2003}.
  Our value would suggest only $\sim$3.3\% of this global net downward flux can be attributed to STT events in the Southern Ocean region, a contribution that is likely too low.
  This result is only marginally sensitive to the latitude range chosen to represent the Southern Ocean (35$^{\circ}$ S-75$^{\circ}$ S): changing this range by 5$^{\circ}$ in either direction at either end of the range changes $\Omega_{SO_{O_3}}$ by -7 to +9\%, with even smaller impacts on the overall flux.
