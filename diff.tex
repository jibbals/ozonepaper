  Stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) provides an important natural source of ozone to the upper troposphere, but the characteristics of STT events in the southern hemisphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extratropics }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{extra-tropics }\DIFaddend and their contribution to the regional tropospheric ozone budget remain poorly constrained.
  Here, we develop a quantitative method to identify STT events from ozonesonde profiles. 
  Using this method we estimate the seasonality \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of STT events }\DIFaddend and quantify the ozone transported across the tropopause over Davis ($69^\circ$ S\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, 2006-2013}\DIFaddend ), Macquarie Island ($54^\circ$ S\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, 2004-2013}\DIFaddend ), and Melbourne ($38^\circ$ S\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, 2004-2013}\DIFaddend ).
  STT seasonality is determined by two distinct methods: a Fourier bandpass filter of the vertical ozone profile, and an analysis of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Brunt-Viäsälä }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} }\DIFaddend frequency.
  Using a bandpass filter on 7--9 years of ozone profiles from each site provides clear detection of STT events, with maximum occurrences during summer and minimum during winter above all three sites.
  The majority of tropospheric ozone enhancements from STT events occur within 2.5~km \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend 3~km of the tropopause at Davis, and Macquarie Island.
  Events are more spread out at Melbourne, occurring frequently up to 7.5~km from the tropopause.
  The mean fraction of total tropospheric ozone attributed to STT during STT events is 2–4\% at each site; however, during individual events over 10\% of tropospheric ozone may be directly transported from the stratosphere.
  The cause of STTs is determined to be largely due to synoptic low pressure frontal systems, determined using coincident ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorological data.
  %Ozone enhancements caused by transported biomass burning plumes are flagged using an analysis of CO column measurements from the AIRS satellite.
  %The effects of African and South American biomass burning are apparent during the austral autumn and winter months.
  Ozone enhancements can also be caused by biomass burning plumes transported from Africa and South America, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which }\DIFaddend are apparent during austral winter and spring, and are determined using satellite measurements of CO.

  To provide regional context for the ozonesonde observations, we use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, which is too coarsely resolved to distinguish STT events but is able to accurately simulate the seasonal cycle of tropospheric ozone columns over the three southern hemisphere sites.
  %The GEOS-Chem model is run with active stratospheric chemistry, however is too coarsely resolved in the vertical and horizontal dimensions to determine STTs.
  %Simulated seasonal cycles of tropospheric ozone are well matched at all three sites although vertical profile averages have some (non-significant) bias in the troposphere compared with ozonesondes.
  Combining the ozonesonde-derived STT event characteristics with the simulated tropospheric ozone columns from GEOS-Chem, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{conservatively estimate that the annual tropospheric ozone flux over the Southern Ocean due to STT events is $\sim3.2\times10^{16}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimate STT ozone flux near the three sites and see austral summer dominated yearly amounts of between  $5.7$ and $8.7 \times 10^{17}$~}\DIFaddend molecules cm$^{-2}$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{yr}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a}\DIFaddend $^{-1}$.

%DIF > \section{Introduction}

  Tropospheric ozone constitutes only 10\% of the total ozone column but is an important oxidant and greenhouse gas which is toxic to life, harming natural ecosystems and reducing agricultural productivity.
  Over the industrial period, increasing tropospheric ozone has been estimated to exert a radiative forcing (RF) of 365~mWm$^{-2}$  \citep{Stevenson2013}, equivalent to a quarter of the CO$_2$ forcing \citep{IPCC_Chapter2}. 
  While much tropospheric ozone is produced photochemically from anthropogenic and natural precursors, %from NO$_x$ and volatile organic compounds, which have both anthropogenic (fossil fuel, biomass combustion) and natural (wildfires, lightning, biogenic) sources.
  downward transport from the ozone-rich stratosphere provides an additional natural source of ozone that is particularly important in the upper troposphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Jacobson2000} }%DIFAUXCMD
and references therein)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[][and references therein]{Jacobson2000}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .
  The contribution of this source to overall tropospheric ozone budgets remains uncertain \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Skerlak2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , especially in the southern hemisphere.
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{While models show decreasing tropospheric ozone due to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Models show }\DIFaddend stratospheric ozone depletion \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has }\DIFaddend propagated to the upper troposphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{through vertical mixing \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

, recent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Stevenson2013}}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
  However, }\DIFaddend work based on the Southern Hemisphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ADditional }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Additional }\DIFaddend OZonesonde (SHADOZ) network suggests \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stratospheric mixing may be }\DIFaddend increasing upper tropospheric ozone near southern Africa \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, most likely due to stratospheric mixing }\DIFdelend \citep{Liu2015, Thompson2014}.
  Uncertainties in the various processes which produce tropospheric ozone limit predictions of future ozone-induced radiative forcing.
  Here we use a multi-year record of ozonesonde observations from sites in the southern hemisphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extratropics}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{extra-tropics}\DIFaddend , combined with a global model, to better characterise the impact of stratospheric ozone on the tropospheric ozone budget in the southern hemisphere.
  %Understanding and accurately portraying ozone concentrations in the troposphere is important to allow accurate predictions of future climate.
  %This will become even more important as projections of future climate changes suggest altered vertical mixing rates, ultra violet index (UVI) and ozone RF \citep{Hegglin2009}.
  % Doesn't really belong in first intro paragraph - maybe in conclusions? -jaf

  Stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) primarily impacts the ozone budget in the upper troposphere but can also increase regional surface ozone levels above the legal thresholds set by air quality standards \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Danielson1968, Lelieveld2009, Lefohn2011, Langford2012, Zhang2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Danielson1968, Lelieveld2009, Lefohn2011, Langford2012, Zhang2014, Lin2015}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .
  In the western US, for example, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{STT events have been shown to contribute up to 30\% of surface ozone in spring \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Lin2012}}%DIFAUXCMD
.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{deep STT events during spring can add 20-40~ppbv of ozone to the ground-level ozone concentration, which can provide over half the ozone needed to exceed the standard set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Lin2012, Lin2015}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
  }\DIFaddend Another important region of STT is the Middle East, where surface ozone \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{excedes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{exceeds }\DIFaddend values of 80~ppbv in summer, with 10~ppbv from STT contribution \citep{Lelieveld2009}.
  Estimates of the overall contribution of STT to tropospheric ozone vary widely \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.,][]{Galani2003, Stohl2003, Stevenson2006, Lefohn2011}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Galani2003, Stohl2003, Stevenson2006, Lefohn2011}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .
  Early work based on two photochemical models showed that 25-50\% of the tropospheric ozone column can be attributed to STT events globally, with most contribution in the upper troposphere \citep{Stohl2003}.
  In contrast, a more recent analysis of the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (ACCMIP) simulations by \citet{Young2013} found \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend STT is responsible for $540\pm140$~Tg yr$^{-1}$, equivalent to $\sim$11\% of the tropospheric ozone column, with the remainder produced photochemically \citep{Monks2015}.
  This wide range in model estimates exists in part because STT is challenging to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{accurately represent, and better }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be accurately represented, and finer }\DIFaddend model resolution is necessary to simulate small scale turbulence.
  Observation-based process studies are therefore key in determining the relative frequency of STT events, with models then able to quantify STT impact over large regions.
  Ozonesondes are particularly valuable for this purpose as they provide multi-year datasets with high vertical resolution.

  Lower stratospheric and upper tropospheric ozone concentrations are highly correlated \citep{Terao2008}, suggesting mixing across the tropopause mainly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{caused by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{associated with }\DIFaddend the jet streams over the ocean.
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Extratropical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Extra-tropical }\DIFaddend STT events most commonly occur during synoptic-scale tropopause folds \citep{Sprenger2003, Tang2012, Frey2015} and are characterised by tongues of high potential vorticity (PV) air descending to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{low }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{lower }\DIFaddend altitudes.
  As these tongues become elongated, filaments disperse away from the tongue and mix irreversibly into the troposphere.
  STT can also be induced by deep overshooting convection \citep{Frey2015}, tropical cyclones \citep{Das2016} and mid-latitude synoptic scale disturbances \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(e. 
  g., \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Stohl2003, Mihalikova2012}}%DIFAUXCMD
). 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Stohl2003, Mihalikova2012}}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
  }\DIFaddend STT events have been observed in tropopause folds around both the polar front jet \citep{Vaughan1994, Beekmann1997} and the subtropical jet \citep{Baray2000}.
  A big influence on the high surface ozone concentrations over the eastern Mediterranean \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(EM) can be attributed to }\DIFaddend stratospheric mixing and anticyclonic subsidence \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Zanis2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Zanis2014, Akritidis2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
  The EM frequently shows a summer maximum of stratospheric subsidence, which sits between 20$^{\circ}$E and 35$^{\circ}$E and 31$^{\circ}$N to 39$^{\circ}$N, while zonally most subtropical tropopause folds occur during winter \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[][and references therein]{Tyrlis2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
  }\DIFaddend They are also observed near cut-off lows \citep{Price1993, Wirth1995}, so both regional weather patterns and stratospheric mixing are important to understand for STT analysis.

  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Stratospheric ozone intrusions undergo transport and mixing, with up to half of the ozone diffusing within 12 hours following descent from the upper troposphere \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

  \DIFaddend %STT events are driven by deep overshooting convection \citep{Frey2015}, tropical cyclones \citep{Das2016} and mid-latitude synoptic scale disturbances (e.g., \citet{Stohl2003, Mihalikova2012}) and are strongly dependent on both season and location. 
  The strength (ozone enhancement above background levels), horizontal scale, vertical depth, and longevity of these intruding ozone tongues vary with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{weather}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{wind direction and strength}\DIFaddend , topography, and season.
  %Because of their dependence on meteorological phenomena, STT events are strongly dependent on both season and location.
  While the frequency, seasonality, and impacts of STT events have been well \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{characterised }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{described }\DIFaddend in the tropics and northern hemisphere (NH), observational estimates from the southern hemisphere (SH) extra-tropics are noticeably absent in the literature. 
  %Since 1998 NASA has tried to standardise ozonesonde release procedures and improve measurement frequency in the SH through the Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesonde (SHADOZ) program (\url{http://croc.gsfc.nasa.gov/shadoz/}).

  %Recent work based on the  Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesonde (SHADOZ) ozonesondes suggests increasing upper tropospheric ozone near southern Africa, most likely due to stratospheric mixing \citep{Liu2015, Thompson2014}.

  %In 2002 \citet{Brinksma2002} examine 5 years of ozonesondes released at Lauder, New Zealand, and show tropospheric ozone depletion following the break up of the polar vortex and dispersion of the ozone hole.
  The role of STT in the SH remains highly uncertain due to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{much }\DIFdelend more limited data availability compared to the NH and the temporal sparsity of these datasets \citep{Mze2010, Thompson2014, Liu2015}.

  %DIF < Tropospheric ozone is lost via chemical destruction and dry deposition, estimated to be $4700\pm700$ Tg yr$^{-1}$ and $1000\pm200$ Tg yr$^{-1}$, respectively \citep{Stevenson2006}.

    Characterisation of STT events requires a clear definition of the tropopause.
    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The two most }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Two }\DIFaddend common tropopause height definitions are the standard lapse rate tropopause \citep{WMO1957} and the ozone tropopause \citep{Bethan1996}.
    The lapse rate tropopause is defined as the lowest altitude where the lapse rate (vertical gradient of temperature) is less than 2$^\circ$C~km$^{-1}$, provided the lapse rate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{averaged }\DIFaddend between this altitude and 2~km above is also below 2$^\circ$C~km$^{-1}$.
    The ozone tropopause is defined as the lowest altitude satisfying the following three conditions for the ozone mixing ratio (OMR) \citep{Bethan1996}:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Vertical gradient of OMR is greater than 60~ppb km$^{-1}$;
      \item OMR is greater than 80~ppb; and
      \item OMR exceeds 110~ppb between 500~m and 2000~m above the altitude under inspection (modified to between 500~m and 1500~m in the Antarctic, including the site at Davis).
    \end{enumerate}
    The ozone tropopause \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can be less robust }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{may misdiagnose the real tropopause altitude }\DIFaddend during stratosphere-troposphere exchange; however, it is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{more robust than the lapse rate tropopause }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{useful }\DIFaddend at polar latitudes in winter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and near jet streams in the lower stratosphere due to temperature inversions near the tropopause \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

    In this work, the lower of these two tropopause altitudes is used.

    \DIFaddend To provide regional and global context to the ozonesonde observations, we use the GEOS-Chem version 10-01 global chemical transport model \citep{Bey2001}, which simulates ozone along with more than 100 other trace gases throughout the troposphere and stratosphere. 
    Stratosphere-troposphere coupling is calculated using the stratospheric unified chemistry extension (UCX) \citep{Eastham2014}.
    Transport is driven by assimilated meteorological fields from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) maintained by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA.
    Ozone precursor emissions are from the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) version 2.1 \citep{Guenther2012} for biogenic emissions, the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) version 4.2 for anthropogenic emissions, and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4) inventory \citep{Giglio2013} for biomass burning emissions. 
    Our simulation was modified from the standard v10-01 to fix an error in the treatment of ozone data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite used to calculate photolysis (see \url{http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/FAST-JX_v7.0_photolysis_mechanism#Fix_for_TOMS_to_address_strange_cycle_in_OH_output.}).  

    Our simulations span 2005-2012 (following a 1-year spin-up) with horizontal resolution of 2$^{\circ}$ latitude by 2.5$^{\circ}$ longitude and 72 vertical levels from the surface to 0.01~hPa.

%DIFDELCMD <     %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \label{sec:CharacterisationOfSTTs}
    \DIFaddend 

    We characterise STT events using the ozonesonde vertical profiles to identify tropospheric ozone enhancements above a local background (in moles per billion moles of dry air, referred to here as ppb).
    %DIF < Calculation of ozone transport is performed after converting the profile to molecules cm$^{-3}$.
    The process is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:filterEG} on an example ozone profile.
    First, the ozone vertical profiles are linearly interpolated to a regular grid with 20~m resolution from the surface to 14~km altitude. 
    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Small vertical-scale fluctuations in ozone, which are captured by the high-resolution ozonesondes, can be regarded as sinusoidal waves superimposed on the large vertical scale background tropospheric ozone.
    As such, the }\DIFaddend interpolated profiles are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{then }\DIFdelend bandpass-filtered using a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Fourier transform to retain perturbations with vertical scales}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fast Fourier transform \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Press1992} }%DIFAUXCMD
to retain these small vertical scales, }\DIFaddend between 0.5~km and 5~km (removing low and high frequency perturbations).
    \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The high frequency perturbations are removed as they may represent noise in the measurements.
    The perturbations with scales longer than 5~km represent the vertical gradient of ozone concentration from the surface to the stratosphere.
    }\DIFaddend In what follows, these filtered vertical profiles are referred to as perturbation profiles.
    \DIFaddbegin 

    \DIFaddend The choice of band limits was set empirically in order to remove the slow positive gradient of ozone over altitude as well as any measurement noise.
    For an event to qualify as STT, a clear increase above the background ozone level is needed, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and we find that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as }\DIFaddend a bandpass filter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{removes seasonal-scale }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{leaves us with enhancements minus any noise or seasonal scale vertical profile }\DIFaddend effects.
    The 0.5~km scale limit is set in order to remove any spikes of ozone which could be considered noise.
    We next use all the perturbation profiles at each site to calculate the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{99th }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{95th }\DIFaddend percentile perturbation value for the site.
    \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The threshold is calculated from all the interpolated filtered values between 2~km above the surface and 1~km below the tropopause.
    }\DIFaddend This is our threshold for tropospheric ozone perturbations, and any profiles with perturbations exceeding this value in individual ozonesondes are classified as STT events.
    STT events at altitudes below 4~km are removed to avoid surface pollution, and events within 0.5~km of the tropopause are removed to avoid false positives induced by the sharp transition to stratospheric air.
    \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We note that this ozone detection methodology detailed above does not allow us to resolve STT events where the ozone flux is spread diffusely across the troposphere without a peak-like structure in the ozonesonde profile. 
    In other words, STT events which might have occurred some distance and time away from the location of the ozonesonde profiles may not be readily detected using the high vertical resolution, but infrequent, ozonesonde launches.

    We define the ozone peak as the altitude where the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OMR is greatest within the lowest range of altitudes over which the perturbation profile exceeds the percentile-based threshold}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{perturbation profile is greatest between 2~km from the surface and 0.5~km below the tropopause}\DIFaddend .
    The STT event is confirmed if the perturbation profile drops below zero between the ozone peak and the tropopause\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, as this represents a return to non-enhanced ozone concentrations}\DIFaddend .
    Alternatively, the STT event is also confirmed if the OMR between the ozone peak and the tropopause drops below 80~ppb and is at least 20~ppb lower than the OMR at the ozone peak. 
    If neither of these conditions are met, the profile is rejected as a non-event.
    This final step removes near-tropopause anomalies for which there is insufficient evidence of detachment from the stratosphere.
    Vertical ozone profiles recorded by ozonesondes are highly dependent on the time of launch \citep{Sprenger2003}, and it cannot be guaranteed that detected ozone enhancements are fully separated from the stratosphere, although this method minimises that risk by removing detected events too near the tropopause.

    We estimate the ozone flux into the troposphere associated with each event by integrating the ozone concentration enhancement vertically over the altitude range for which an STT event is identified (i.e. enhancement near the ozone peak over which the perturbation profile is greater than zero).
    This estimate is conservative because it does not take into account any ozone enhancements outside of the detected peak that may have been caused by the STT, and also ignores any enhanced ozone background amounts from synoptic-scale stratospheric mixing into the troposphere.

    Our method differs somewhat from that used by \citet{Tang2010} to detect STT events from ozonesonde measurements. 
    Their definition is based on subjective analysis of sondes released from 20 stations ranging in latitude from 35$^\circ$ S to 40$^\circ$ N.
    They identify an STT event if, starting from 5~km altitude, ozone exceeds 80~ppb and then within 3~km decreases by 20~ppb or more to a value less than 120~ppb.
    Their technique would miss many events due to the lower ozone concentrations found in the cleaner Southern Hemisphere.

    Large biomass burning events emit substantial quantities of ozone precursors, some of which are capable of being transported \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{over }\DIFaddend long distances and driving ozone production far from the fire source \citep{Jaffe2012}.
    Ozone production from biomass burning is complex and affected by photochemistry, fuel nitrogen load, and time since emission, among other factors. 
    While ozone production occurs in some biomass burning plumes, this is not always the case; therefore ozone perturbations detected during transported smoke events may or may not be caused by the plume.
    For this reason all detected STT events \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{found near }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which could be caused by }\DIFaddend smoke plumes are flagged\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, following the procedure outlined below}\DIFaddend .
    Calculations of seasonality, and ozone flux do not include flagged events, however they are included in summary plots in this work.

    %Biomass burning influence in the Southern Hemisphere comes mostly from Southern Africa and South America, however Australian fires from the midlatitudes, and Indonesian fires can also influence the ozonesonde release sites.
    %Transported biomass burning plumes influence the southern mid-latitudes generally between July and December \citep{Pak2003}.

    Possible biomass burning influence is identified using satellite observations of CO from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infra-red Sounder) instrument on board the Aqua satellite \citep{AIRS3STD}.
    CO is emitted during incomplete combustion and is an effective tracer of long-range transport due to its long lifetime \citep{Edwards2003, Edwards2006}.
    In the Southern Hemisphere, biomass burning is the primary source of CO, making CO a good proxy for fire plumes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(e.

    Smoke plumes are diagnosed over areas with elevated CO columns ($\sim 2 \times 10^{18}$ molecules cm$^{-2}$ or higher), and any sonde-detected STT event that occurs near \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(within $\sim$150~km of) }\DIFaddend a smoke plume is flagged.

  There is an annual cycle in the frequency of STT events  (Fig. \ref{fig:SummarySeasonality}) with a summertime peak at all three sites.
  This summertime peak is due to a prevalence of summer low-pressure storms and fronts, which increase turbulence and lower the tropopause \citep{Reutter2015}.
  At Davis, there \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is increased Antarctic winter activity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are more STT detections during winter relative to our other sites}\DIFaddend , which may be due to the polar vortex and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{its }\DIFaddend associated lowered tropopause and increased turbulence.
  STT events associated with cut-off low pressure systems are more prevalent during summer\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(winter for Davis)}\DIFdelend , while STT events associated with frontal passage occur throughout the year.

  \DIFadd{The SH summer maximum we see for STT ozone flux can also be seen in Fig. 16 of \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

  The seasonality of our three sites is not driven by the larger STT system seen over the southern Indian ocean and middle Australia which dominates prior analysis near or over Australia.
  }

  \DIFaddend To examine the robustness of the distributions shown in Fig. \ref{fig:SummarySeasonality}, we developed an alternative assessment of the seasonal occurrence of STT events, with results shown in Fig. \ref{fig:AndrewProxySTT}.
  Here STT occurrence is evaluated by consideration of the square of the dry \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Brunt-Viäsälä }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} }\DIFaddend frequency (N$^2$) at the heights of the ozone tropopause (z$_{OT}$) and lapse rate tropopause (z$_{LRT}$) in each ozonesonde profile that has been binned to 500~m resolution.
  We use N$^2$ to assess atmospheric stability, which is normally distinctly higher in the stratosphere than in the troposphere, and assume that the vertical temperature gradients within the intrusion respond most rapidly to transported heat, which is an additional characteristic of stratospheric air.
  The altitude binning chosen is a compromise between vertical resolution and the level of variability in N$^2$ introduced by temperature gradients associated with perturbations from gravity waves and changes near the lapse rate tropopause, and is the minimum that produces a robust seasonal distribution.
  We define STT as having taken place if N$^2$(z$_{OT}$) $>$ N$^2$(z$_{LRT}$) and z$_{OT}$ $<$ z$_{LRT}$; in this way the characteristically higher static stability and ozone concentration of stratospheric intrusion is regarded as being retained as it penetrates below the lapse rate tropopause. 
  The seasonal distributions shown for the three stations in Fig. \ref{fig:AndrewProxySTT} are generally similar to those shown in Fig. \ref{fig:SummarySeasonality} (although detected events are less frequent), with the main exception that no events are identified with the alternative method at Davis in the first half of the year.
  From December to June, ozonesondes are generally only launched monthly at Davis, and the lack of STT events in these months for Davis potentially reflects the fewer measurement opportunities.

  Figure \ref{fig:SummaryAltitudes} shows the altitudes of detected events, based on the altitude of peak tropospheric ozone (local maximum ozone within enhancement altitude) in the ozonesonde profile.

  GEOS-Chem provides a reasonable simulation of the observed seasonality and magnitude of $\Omega_{O_3}$.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \label{sec:STTevents}
  \subsection{\DIFadd{Method}}
  \label{sec:fluxcalc}
    \DIFaddend We quantify the mean stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux due to STT events at each site based on the integrated ozone amount associated with each STT event (see Sect. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Section:CharacterisationOfSTTs}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{sec:CharacterisationOfSTTs}}\DIFaddend ).
    Events that may have been influenced by transported biomass burning are excluded from this calculation.
    Our estimate provides a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{conservative lower bound for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{preliminary estimate of }\DIFaddend how much ozone is transported from the stratosphere \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by the events detected by our method}\DIFaddend .
    The estimate is conservative for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{two main }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{several }\DIFaddend reasons: it ignores secondary ozone peaks which may also be transported from the stratosphere, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend it ignores potential ozone enhancements which may have dispersed and increased the local background mixing ratio\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and any influence from STT events nearby which may also increase the local background ozone}\DIFaddend .

    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Observed tropospheric columns are calculated from the ozonesondes by calculating the ozone number density (molecules cm$^{-3}$) using measured ozone partial pressure (P$_{O_3}$) and integrating vertically up to the tropopause:

    \DIFadd{where $z$ is the altitude (GPH), $TP$ is the altitude at the tropopause, $T$ is the temperature, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.
    }

    \DIFadd{Three regions are used to examine possible STT flux over a larger area using modeled tropospheric ozone concentrations.
    The regions are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ComparisonRegion}.
    The regions are centred at each site, plus or minus ten degrees latitude, and plus or minus 25, 16, and 11 degrees longitude for Davis, Macquarie Island, and Melbourne respectively.
    These boundaries approximate a rectangle centred at each site with $\sim 2000$~km side lengths, covering $\sim 4.4$, $4.6$, and $4.8$ million square km, for Davis, Macquarie Island, and Melbourne respectively.
    }

    \DIFadd{To determine the ozone column attributable to STT, we determine monthly averaged STT impact (}\textit{\DIFadd{I}}\DIFadd{; fraction of tropospheric ozone sourced from the stratosphere as shown above) and the monthly mean tropospheric ozone column (from the GEOS-Chem multi-year mean, $\Omega_{O_3}$) over the regions described above.
    This can be expressed simply as the STT flux per event (flux$_i$ in each month: flux$_i = \Omega_{O_3} \times I$.
    Next we determine how many events are occurring per month by assuming only one event can occur at one time, and that no event is measured twice.
    These assumptions allow a simple estimate of events per month from the relatively sparse dataset and should hold true as long as our regions of extrapolation are not too large.
    The ($P$)robability of any sonde launch detecting an event is calculated as the fraction of ozonesonde releases for which an STT event was detected, calculated for each month.
    If we assume events last N days, we find how many events per month by multiplying the days in a month by $P$ and dividing by the assumed event lifetime.
    For example if we expect to see an event 25\% of the time in a month, and events last one day, we expect one event every four days ($\sim 7.5$ events in that month) whereas if we expect events to last a week then we would expect $\sim$one event in that month.
    This leads us to multiply our flux$_i$ by $P$, and then by the term $M$ ($M= \frac{\text{days per month}}{N}$) determined by our assumed event lifetime in order to determine monthly STT ozone flux.
    }

    \DIFadd{The longevity of ozone events is very difficult to determine, and we have chosen 2 days as a representative number based on several examples in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Lin2012} }%DIFAUXCMD
where intrusions were seen to last from 1-3 days (occasionally longer) and an analysis of one large event by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

showing that most of the ozone had dispersed after 48 hours.
    Worth noting is the recent work of \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Trickl2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
, where intrusions are detected $>2$ days and thousands of kilometres away from their initial descent into the troposphere over Greenland or the Arctic.
    In those regions with high wind shear, mixing appears to be slower, which allows ozone intrusions to be transported further without dissipating into the troposphere.
    Relative uncertainty in our $M$ term is set to 50\%, as we assume these synoptic events to generally last from 1-3 days.

    Using the algorithm discussed in Sect. \ref{sec:CharacterisationOfSTTs}, we detect 46 events at Davis, 47 (+8 fire influenced) events at Macquarie Island, and 73 (+14 fire influenced) events at Melbourne.
    }\DIFaddend 

    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Summing the monthly estimated fluxes shown in Fig. \ref{fig:SOExtrapolation} over the year, we find from this estimate that STT events may be responsible for at least $3.1 \times10^{16}$~molecules cm$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ of the tropospheric ozone over the Southern Ocean, equivalent to 2.48~Tg yr$^{-1}$.

    Event detection is therefore also sensitive to the range over which the percentile is calculated (2~km above the earth's surface to 1~km below the tropopause).
    This range was chosen to remove anomalous edge effects of the Fourier bandpass filter and to discount the highly variable ozone concentration which occurs near the tropopause.
    }

    \DIFadd{Ozone enhancements are only considered STT events if they occur from 4~km altitude up to 500~m below the tropopause.
    This range removes possible ground pollution and events not sufficiently separated from the stratosphere, while still capturing many well-defined events that occur within 1~km of the tropopause.
    An example of a well-defined event that occurs within 1~km of the tropopause is shown in the supplementary (Fig. S2).
    However, STT events which reach below 4~km are physically possible and we may have some false negative detections due to the altitude restricted detections.

    %DIF > The event detection was less sensitive to the choice of Fourier bandpass scales: widening the allowed scales from the range 0.5-5.0~km to 0.4-5.1~km increased the detected events by 3 at Melbourne and 2 at Macquarie Island. 
    %DIF > Meanwhile, 2 fewer events were detected at Davis because the change to bandpass scales resulted in an increase in the threshold value calculated from the perturbed profiles (removing some detected events which were no longer larger than the new threshold).

  \subsection{\DIFadd{Flux calculations}}
    \label{sec:fluxuncertainty}
    \DIFadd{Flux is calculated as $ I \times P \times M \times \Omega_{O_3}$, with each term calculated as described in Sect. \ref{sec:fluxcalc}.
    The uncertainty is determined using the standard deviation of the product, with variance calculated using the variance of a product formula, assuming that each of our terms is independent: 
    }\begin{equation*} \DIFadd{var(\Pi_i X_i) = \Pi_i ( var(X_i) + E(X_i)^2 ) - (\Pi_i E(X_i))^2 }\end{equation*}
    \DIFadd{The standard deviations for the $I$ and $\Omega_{O_3}$ terms are calculated over the entire dataset.
    These terms are considered to be homoskedastic (unchanging variance over time).
    Uncertainty in assumed event lifetime is set at 50\%, as we believe it is reasonable to expect events to last 1-3 days.
    $P$ is the probability of any ozonesonde detecting an event, and is assumed to be constant (for any month).
    The overall uncertainty as a percentage is shown in parentheses in Table \ref{table:extrapolationResults}, these values are on the order of 100\%, largely due to relative uncertainty in the $I$ factor which ranges from 50-120\% for each month.
    }

    \DIFadd{Small changes in the region don't have a large affect on the per area flux calculations, with an increasing or decreasing the regions by 1$^{\circ}$ on each side ($\sim 10\%$ change in area) changing the resulting flux by $\sim 1\%$. %DIF >  units of ~Kg cm$^{-2}$.
    However due to the large portion of winter STT events being flagged due to potential smoke plume influence, a significant change in the yearly flux is seen when we don't remove these events.
    Without removing smoke flagged events we see an increase in estimated yearly flux of $\sim 1.1, 2.1 \times 10^{17} $~molecules cm$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ (which is a change of $\sim 15, 20\%$), over Macquarie Island and Melbourne respectively.
    }

    \DIFadd{Considering the $I$ factor, as discussed in here and in }\DIFaddend Sect. \ref{sec:sensitivity}, there are several uncertainties in our method that are likely to lead to a low bias\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the overall extrapolated flux, including a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, such as the }\DIFaddend conservative estimate of flux within each event\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and a process that excludes potential events which are too close to the tropopause or to transported smoke plumes.

%\section{Conclusions}

Stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) can be a major source of ozone to the remote free troposphere, but the occurrence and influence of STT events remains poorly quantified in the southern \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hemisphere (SH) extratropics}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{extra-tropics}\DIFaddend .
Ozonesonde observations in the SH provide a satellite-independent quantification of the frequency of STT events, as well as an estimate of their impact and source.
%The frequency and amount of ozone descending from the stratosphere into the troposphere can be estimated from the long time series of tropospheric ozone profiles.
Using almost ten years of ozonesonde profiles over the southern high latitudes, we have quantified the frequency, seasonality, and altitude distributions of STT events in the SH \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extratropics}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{extra-tropics}\DIFaddend . 
By combining this information with ozone column estimates from a global chemical transport model, we provided a first, conservative estimate of the influence of STT events on tropospheric ozone over the Southern Ocean.

Our method involved applying a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Fourier }\DIFdelend bandpass filter to the measured ozone profiles to determine STT event occurrence and strength.
The filter removed seasonal influences and allowed clear detection of ozone-enhanced tongues of air in the troposphere.
By setting empirically-derived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{threshholds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{thresholds}\DIFaddend , this method clearly distinguished tropospheric ozone enhancements that are separated from the stratosphere.
Our method is sensitive to various parameters involved in the calculation; however, for our sites we saw \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{no }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{few }\DIFaddend false positive detections of STT events.

Detected STT events at three sites spanning the SH extra-tropics (38$^{\circ}$S, 55$^{\circ}$S, and 69$^{\circ}$S) showed a distinct seasonal cycle.
All three sites displayed a summer (DJF) maximum and winter (JJA) minimum, although the seasonal amplitude was less apparent at the Antarctic site (Davis) as events were also detected regularly in winter and spring (likely due to polar jet stream-caused turbulence).  %The cause of these ozone enhancements is examined through the use of satellite CO data (to determine fire influence) and ERA-I meteorological data.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Comparison with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Analysis of }\DIFaddend ERA-Interim reanalysis data suggested the majority of events were caused by turbulent weather in the upper troposphere due to low pressure fronts, followed by cut-off low pressure systems.
Comparison of ozonesonde-measured ozone profiles against those simulated by the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model showed the model is able to reproduce seasonal features but does not have sufficient vertical resolution to distinguish STT events.
%The seasonal features in the ozonesonde record of tropospheric ozone columns are well represented by the model.
%Simulated profiles generally can not identify STT events due to their lower vertical resolution.

By combining the simulated tropospheric column ozone from GEOS-Chem with ozonesonde-derived STT estimates, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{provided }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provide }\DIFaddend a first estimate of the total contribution of STT events to tropospheric ozone \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{over the Southern Ocean}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in these southern extra-tropical regions}\DIFaddend .
We conservatively estimated that the ozone enhancement due to STT events \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{near }\DIFaddend our three sites ranges from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$1$-$6 \times 10^{16}$ molecules cm}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{300-570~kg km}\DIFaddend $^{-2}$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
This method implies that STT events can only explain $\sim$3\% of the global net downward flux of ozone, avalue that is likely too low.
Replacing the sonde-derived estimate of the ozone fraction associated with each STT event with a value derived from a global model \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Terao2008} }%DIFAUXCMD
increases this estimate by an order of magnitude.

Estimating STT flux using ozonesonde data alone remains challenging; however, the very high vertical resolution provided by ozonesondes means they are capable of detecting STT events that models, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reanalyses}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{re-analyses}\DIFaddend , and satellites may not. 
Further work is needed to more accurately translate these ozonesonde measurements into STT ozone fluxes, particularly in the SH where data are sparse and STT is likely to be a major contributor to upper tropsopheric ozone in some regions.
More frequent ozonesonde releases at SH sites \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{would }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{could }\DIFaddend facilitate development of better STT flux estimates for this region.
%As the climate alters, an understanding of mixing between the stratosphere and troposphere over the southern ocean will help diagnose potential hazards.
%Seasonality and impact of stratospheric ozone are changing over time, furter analysis of this long term set of ozonesonde data will be useful into the future.
