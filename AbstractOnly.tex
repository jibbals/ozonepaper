  Stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) provides an important natural source of ozone to the upper troposphere, but the characteristics of STT events in the southern hemisphere extra-tropics and their contribution to the regional tropospheric ozone budget remain poorly constrained.
  Here, we develop a quantitative method to identify STT events from ozonesonde profiles. 
  Using this method we estimate the seasonality of STT events and quantify the ozone transported across the tropopause over Davis ($69^\circ$ S, 2006-2013), Macquarie Island ($54^\circ$ S, 2004-2013), and Melbourne ($38^\circ$ S, 2004-2013).
  STT seasonality is determined by two distinct methods: a Fourier bandpass filter of the vertical ozone profile, and an analysis of the Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} frequency.
  Using a bandpass filter on 7--9 years of ozone profiles from each site provides clear detection of STT events, with maximum occurrences during summer and minimum during winter above all three sites.
  The majority of tropospheric ozone enhancements from STT events occur within 2.5~km and 3~km of the tropopause at Davis, and Macquarie Island.
  Events are more spread out at Melbourne, occurring frequently up to 6~km from the tropopause.
  The mean fraction of total tropospheric ozone attributed to STT during STT events is $\sim 1.0$--$3.5\%$ at each site; however, during individual events over 10\% of tropospheric ozone may be directly transported from the stratosphere.
  The cause of STTs is determined to be largely due to synoptic low pressure frontal systems, determined using coincident ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorological data.
  %Ozone enhancements caused by transported biomass burning plumes are flagged using an analysis of CO column measurements from the AIRS satellite.
  %The effects of African and South American biomass burning are apparent during the austral autumn and winter months.
  Ozone enhancements can also be caused by biomass burning plumes transported from Africa and South America, which are apparent during austral winter and spring, and are determined using satellite measurements of CO.
  
  To provide regional context for the ozonesonde observations, we use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, which is too coarsely resolved to distinguish STT events but is able to accurately simulate the seasonal cycle of tropospheric ozone columns over the three southern hemisphere sites.
  %The GEOS-Chem model is run with active stratospheric chemistry, however is too coarsely resolved in the vertical and horizontal dimensions to determine STTs.
  %Simulated seasonal cycles of tropospheric ozone are well matched at all three sites although vertical profile averages have some (non-significant) bias in the troposphere compared with ozonesondes.
  Combining the ozonesonde-derived STT event characteristics with the simulated tropospheric ozone columns from GEOS-Chem, we estimate STT ozone flux near the three sites and see austral summer dominated yearly amounts of between  $5.7$ and $8.7 \times 10^{17}$~molecules cm$^{-2}$ a$^{-1}$.
