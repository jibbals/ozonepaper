\authorcontribution{JG wrote the algorithms, ran the GEOS-Chem simulations, performed the analysis and led the writing of the paper under the supervision and guidance of SPA, RS, and JAF. AK contributed the Davis ozonesonde data and performed the analysis of the alternate STT proxy. All authors contributed to editing and revising the manuscript.}

% Authored and edited this manuscript, as well as analysing the datasets, under the supervision of Dr. Alexander, Dr. Fisher, and Dr. Schofield.
%Mr. Greenslade ran GEOS-Chem and analysed the output.
%Dr. Alexander provided the IDL scripts which initially read and bandpassed the ozonesonde profiles.
%Dr. Schofield outlined the introduction and story of the paper.
%Dr. Klekociuk provided the static stability analysis as an alternative to the bandpass filter method.
%Dr. J. A. Fisher who edited or supplied feedback for much of the manuscript.}

We thank the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Antarctic Division for providing the ozonesonde data. 
The ERA-Interim data were downloaded from the ECMWF website following registration.
This work was commenced with support from the Australian Department of the Environment summer ozone science scholarship and partly supported by research project 4012 of the Australian Antarctic Programme.
This research was undertaken with the assistance of resources provided at the NCI National Facility systems at the Australian National University through the National Computational Merit Allocation Scheme supported by the Australian Government.
This work was supported through funding by the Australian Government's Australian Antarctic science grant program (FoRCES 4012), the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (CE110001028), the Commonwealth Department of the Environment ozone summer scholar program.
Dr. Clare Paton Walsh identified the need to account for smoke-influenced events, and provided discussions on how to go about doing such.
